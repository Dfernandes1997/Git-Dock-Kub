## Conflict Situations

#### Conflict Situation 1: Code Conflicts

**Issue:**
- Another team member also made changes in the same files, and there are conflicts.

**Resolution:**
- Regularly pull changes from the main branch to your local branch to avoid conflicts.
  ```bash
  git checkout main
  git pull origin main
  git checkout feature/add-homepage
  git merge main
  ```
- Resolve conflicts locally, commit changes, and push again.

#### Conflict Situation 2: Discussion and Code Review

**Issue:**
- A team member suggests changes in your PR, and there's a discussion about the proposed modifications.

**Resolution:**
- Address comments and make necessary changes in your branch.
- Update the existing commit and force-push (use with caution):
  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit --amend
  git push origin feature/add-homepage --force
  ```

#### Conflict Situation 3: Team Member Wants to Collaborate on the Same Branch

**Issue:**
- Another team member wants to collaborate on the same branch.

**Resolution:**
- Encourage them to create a new branch from the main branch or your feature branch to avoid conflicts.

#### Final Steps

8. **Merge the Pull Request:**
   - Once the changes are approved and conflicts are resolved, you can merge your PR into the main branch.

9. **Delete Feature Branch:**
   ```bash
   git branch -d feature/add-homepage  # locally
   git push origin --delete feature/add-homepage  # on GitHub
   ```

10. **Keep Synced:**
    - Periodically, sync your local repository with the main branch.

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

By following these steps and being mindful of potential conflict situations, you can contribute to a collaborative development process on GitHub smoothly. Communication with your team, regular updates, and addressing conflicts proactively are key to successful collaboration.
