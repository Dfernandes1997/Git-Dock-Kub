# Networking and Storage

Welcome to the "Networking and Storage" tutorial. In this tutorial, you'll explore the aspects of container networking, data management, and persistent storage options in Docker.

## Container Networking

Container networking is a vital aspect of running multiple containers and enabling communication between them. You'll delve into:

- Different network modes in Docker, including bridge, host, and overlay networks.
- Creating custom networks to isolate container communication.
- Configuring port mapping to expose container services to the host and external world.

## Data Management

Data management is a critical consideration when working with containers. You'll learn how to:

- Manage data within containers.
- Use volumes to persist data across container restarts.
- Share data between containers.

## Persistent Storage

In some cases, you need persistent storage for your containers. You'll explore various options for providing persistent storage:

- Docker volumes: Managing data volumes for containers.
- Bind mounts: Mounting host file system paths into containers.
- Third-party storage solutions for enterprise use.

Prepare to tackle the challenges of networking and storage in Docker containerization!
