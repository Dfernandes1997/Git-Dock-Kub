# Working with Containers

Welcome to the "Working with Containers" tutorial. In this section, you'll learn how to manage containers, run multiple containers, and understand container networking.

## Running and Managing Containers

Docker containers are the heart of Docker. You can run, manage, and interact with them using various Docker commands. Here are some key tasks you'll explore in this tutorial:

- Running a container from an image.
- Listing running and stopped containers.
- Starting, stopping, and removing containers.
- Accessing a shell inside a running container.

## Running Multiple Containers

In real-world scenarios, you often need to run multiple containers to build complex applications. You'll learn how to:

- Run multiple containers independently.
- Create networks for communication between containers.
- Use Docker Compose to define and manage multi-container applications.

## Container Networking

Container networking is a crucial aspect of Docker. You'll discover how containers can communicate with each other and with the outside world:

- Exploring different network modes in Docker.
- Creating custom networks for your applications.
- Configuring port mapping to expose container services to the host.

Get ready to explore the world of containers and their management!
